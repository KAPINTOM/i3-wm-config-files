## Customization

This configuration is designed to be modular and easy to customize. Here are some tips:

- **Keybindings**: Edit the `~/.config/i3/config` file to modify or add keybindings.
- **Theming**: Adjust colors and styles in the `~/.config/i3/theme` file.
- **Autostart**: Add or remove applications in the `~/.config/i3/autostart` script.
- **i3bar**: Customize the status bar in the `~/.config/i3/i3status.conf` file.

## Dependencies

This configuration relies on several external tools and utilities. Ensure you have the following installed:

- **i3**: The window manager itself.
- **i3status**: Status bar for i3.
- **rofi**: Application launcher.
- **picom**: Compositor for transparency and shadows.
